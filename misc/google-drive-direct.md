### Accessing Google Drive Directly

- Create a public folder
- Open the newly created public directory
- In the URL link there should be a string of random characters following the:

```
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/<unique id string>
```
- You can now access the direct url at:

```
http://googledrive.com/host/<unique id string>/<file name>
```
