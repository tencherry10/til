## On Error Handling

First off, a distinction need to be made between **errors** and **exception**:

- An error is a programing state / condition where it is impossible for the program itself to handle and 
  that a programmer must alter code in order to repair.
  

- OTOH, an exception denotes a relatively unpredictable and seldom condition that can be handled by the program itself.
  
  In fact an unhandled exception is an error
