### OOP

The distinctive features of Object-Oriented Programming are:

1. Encapsulation - Hiding state / details behind the Object's API (or methods). 
  
  The main goal of Encapsulation is separation of concerns, 
  changing the private implementation details of an object should not break its clients' code.
1. Inheritance - Code reuse mechanism via cloning of state and methods. 
  
  The actual details vary from language to language. For e.g. 
  - In Java method inheritance is automatic unless you opt-out with final
  - In C++ inheritance is not enabled unless you opt-in with virtual
  - In javascript the inheritance is based on an existing prototype (rather than a template)
  - In lua the inheritance is based on a "meta" table which you can manipulate quite like a regular table
  
  The point is that inheritance as code reuse means different things in different language
1. Polymorphism - Poly
