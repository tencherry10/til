### OOP

The distinctive features of Object-Oriented Programming are:
1. Encapsulation - hiding state / details behind the Object's API (or methods)
1. Inheritance - Code reuse mechanism via cloning of state and methods. 
  The actual details vary from language to language. For e.g. 
  - In Java method inheritance is automatic unless you opt-out with final
  - In C++ inheritance is not enabled unless you opt-in with virtual
  - In javascript the inheritance is based on an existing prototype (rather than a template)
  - In lua the inheritance is based on a "meta" table which you can manipulate quite like a regular table
