### Merging an Upstream repo into a fork

checkout the branch you wish to merge to (maybe ```master``` or ```upstream```)

``` 
$ git checkout upstream
```

Pull the desired branch from upstream into your branch

```
$ git pull https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git BRANCH_NAME
```
