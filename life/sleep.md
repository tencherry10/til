# Sleep, Memory, and Psychiatric Health

## important points

- Sleep is strongly related to learning. 
  What you initially learn when you are awake is actually pretty crass 
  compared to the final form the memory / knowledge end up in. 
  A lot of the post-encoding, organization, and restructing process that turns 
  scattered short-term memory into long-term memory happens while you sleep.

## interesting facts

- Brain doens't shut down during sleep. 
  In fact it is just as active (if not more active) during sleep than when we are awake.
- Sleep occurs in cycles of deep and shallow sleep (REM - Rapid Eye Movements). 
- Cycles are roughly 90 mins in duration.
- In the first couple of cycles, we spend more time in the deep sleep (SWS - slow wave sleep).
  And as the sleep progresses, the sleep cycles get shallower and shallower (REM period longer and longer).
