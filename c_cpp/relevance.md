## Why C is still Relevant


### Truly a System Language from the inside-out

* Only language that is supported via a FFI from all other programming language
* Only language that is supported **first** for on moderm processors. In fact most modern processors have customer pointer and add instructions that are designed to accelerated C generated code.
* Only language that makes no assumption so that everything else can use it. So, no assumptions on GC, platform specific calling convention, no assumptions on default types / or even integer sizes.
